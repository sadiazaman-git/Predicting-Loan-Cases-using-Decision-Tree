# Project Background & Aims

In this notebook, you will be using **Pandas** to read the dataset and to perform data analysis. We will
also be using **matplotlib** for data visualisation. The notebook will further expand your understanding of
**data preprocessing**, by implementing some of the key pre‑processing steps. 

We will be using **sklearn**
for using data mining and **machine learning (ML) algorithms**. The scikit‑learn or sklearn is an opensource
Machine Learning library available in Python for building effective and efficient models. It is built
on **NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib**. You will also be using NumPy library, which is for numeric
calculations. NumPy is n‑dimensional array, and it is used for Numerical Python, including basic linear
algebra functions, Fourier transforms, advanced random number capabilities.

In this notebook, we will build a **decision tree model to predict whether an applicant is eligible for the
loan or not based on the given applicant's information?** To achieve this, we will first perform some data
analysis and data pre‑processing, which includes dealing with missing values and outliers values
that appear in the dataset. We will then use sklearn to build decision tree classifier.
